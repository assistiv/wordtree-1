He feels intimidated by the searches and feels that the policy is unfair when applied to every prisoner rather than where there is a specific reason to justify such searches. George is charged with an offence against prison discipline as it is alleged that he disobeyed a lawful order as part of the disciplinary code. The charges were heard by the Prison's Deputy Governor appointed by the Governor to hear disciplinary charges against prisoners. The Deputy Governor was also responsible for implementing searches and was present when George refused to comply with the search.
